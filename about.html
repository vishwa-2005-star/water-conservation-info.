  <h2>Water Conservation Systems:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Rainwater Harvesting</strong></li>
    <p>Collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops or surfaces for reuse in irrigation, cleaning, or even potable use after treatment.</p>

    <li><strong>Greywater Recycling</strong></li>
    <p>Reusing water from sinks, showers, and laundry for landscaping or toilet flushing, reducing freshwater demand.</p>

    <li><strong>Dual Flush Toilets</strong></li>
    <p>Toilets with two flush options—light for liquid waste and full for solid waste—to reduce water usage per flush.</p>

    <li><strong>Drip Irrigation</strong></li>
    <p>A method where water drips slowly to the plant roots, minimizing evaporation and water waste in agriculture.</p>

    <li><strong>Sprinkler Irrigation</strong></li>
    <p>Distributes water through a system of pipes and sprinklers, mimicking rainfall and ensuring even water distribution.</p>

    <li><strong>Mulching</strong></li>
    <p>Applying organic or inorganic materials to soil surfaces to retain moisture, regulate temperature, and reduce evaporation.</p>

    <li><strong>Rainwater Storage Tanks</strong></li>
    <p>Large tanks that store harvested rainwater for household or agricultural use during dry periods.</p>

    <li><strong>Dams</strong></li>
    <p>Structures built across rivers to store large volumes of water for irrigation, drinking, flood control, and power generation.</p>

    <li><strong>Farm Ponds</strong></li>
    <p>Small water reservoirs constructed on farms to store runoff or rainwater for irrigation and livestock.</p>

    <li><strong>Water Recycling Plant</strong></li>
    <p>Treatment facilities that purify wastewater so it can be safely reused for industrial, agricultural, or even potable purposes.</p>

    <li><strong>Terracing</strong></li>
    <p>Creating step-like fields on slopes to reduce runoff and increase water infiltration into the soil.</p>

    <li><strong>Contour Bunding</strong></li>
    <p>Building barriers along land contours to reduce soil erosion and improve water absorption in agricultural lands.</p>

    <li><strong>Leak Detection System</strong></li>
    <p>Technology used to identify and fix water leaks in pipelines to prevent wastage and ensure system efficiency.</p>

    <li><strong>Smart Water Meter</strong></li>
    <p>Digital meters that monitor water usage in real-time, helping users detect leaks and track consumption patterns.</p>

    <li><strong>Nala Plugging</strong></li>
    <p>Blocking small streams (nala) using local materials to slow down water flow and promote groundwater recharge.</p>
